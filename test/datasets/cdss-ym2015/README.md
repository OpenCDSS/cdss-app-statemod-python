These files are CDSS Yampa basin data files used for StateMod Java testing.
For the full set of files download the
[CDSS Yampa dataset](https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdss/surface-water-statemod) dataset.
The `StateMod` folder contents have been copied here in order to have a full dataset for testing.

The experimental
[cdss-model-cu-sw-yampa](https://github.com/OpenWaterFoundation/cdss-model-cu-sw-yampa) repository
provides some additional documentation in the form of README files.

The dataset is described by the list of files in the "response file" (`*.rsp`).
